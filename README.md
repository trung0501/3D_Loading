🏷️ Program name: 3D Loading Animation

🎯 Program Purpose: Create a vivid 3D animation effect simulating the rotating motion of an object (circle), combined with the word "Loading" to signal to users that the system is processing or downloading content.

🧩 The main component of the program:

    📄 HTML: The page structure includes the words "Loading" and a block containing 3D rotation.

    🎨 CSS: Layout format, color, background effect and 3D rotating animations.

    @keyframes rotating:Create continuous rotation around the Y axis for the mint color circle. 

⚙️ Principle of operation:

    . The words "Loading" are placed fixed in the middle of the screen by transform property: Translate (-50%, -50%).

    . The main ingredient that creates the effect is the <div class = "rotate">, containing a color circle of mint set by :: after.

    . Both the .rotate and .rotate :: afterter are applied the rotatey effect in the opposite direction to create 3D rotating effects.

    . perspective and transform-style: preserve-3D are used to create space depth, helping the rotating effect feel stereoscopic.

    . Box-shadow components and light effects are used to highlight the feeling of 3D and contrast.

✅ Advantages:

    . Beautiful 3D effects: Create a sense of depth and true motion.

    . Modern style: Suitable for technology interfaces, professional applications.

    . Clear interface: The word "Loading" put the center, easy to see and communicate clear goals.

    . High customization: Easy to edit colors, rotation speed or rotating object shape.

⚠️ Limit:
       
    . No actual process connection: The effect runs continuously without reflecting the actual state of data download.

    . Optimization of performance: On weak devices or old browsers, 3D and continuous rotation can cause shock/lag.

    . No JavaScript: There is no condition to stop the effect or attach to the actual load event.

    . It is difficult to expand for many steping steps: the current interface only shows the "waiting" state without reflecting the progress or load percentage.
